# RUST

welcome to rust

we declare functions using fn
to print out you use println! - this is standard output.
we end statements with semicolons.

to run a`.rs` file you need to first get a compiled version of it...thats you `rustc name-of-your-project`, then it will give you it's brinary in which now you can run it.
