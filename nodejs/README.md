# NODEJS

Take your [javascript](../javascript/) skills to the server-side.
Node is a javascript runtime. Node simply allows you to run JavaScript code on a machine such as your local computer or a server without having to go through a web browser.

Node can read or write local files, create HTTP connections and listen to network requests.

Node is event-driven.
