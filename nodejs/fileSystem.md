# FILE SYSTEM

This fs module, provides a lot of very useful functionality to access files  and interact with the file system.

this module is part of the node.js core so to use it in a js file you `const fs = require('fs')`.

from there you can have access to the following functions:

1. fs.access(): check if the file exists and Node.js can access it with its permissions
fs.appendFile(): append data to a file. If the file does not exist, it's created
fs.chmod(): change the permissions of a file specified by the filename passed. Related: fs.lchmod(), fs.fchmod()
fs.chown(): change the owner and group of a file specified by the filename passed. Related: fs.fchown(), fs.lchown()
fs.close(): close a file descriptor
fs.copyFile(): copies a file
fs.createReadStream(): create a readable file stream
fs.createWriteStream(): create a writable file stream
fs.link(): create a new hard link to a file
fs.mkdir(): create a new folder
fs.mkdtemp(): create a temporary directory
fs.open(): opens the file and returns a file descriptor to allow file manipulation
fs.readdir(): read the contents of a directory
fs.readFile(): read the content of a file. Related: fs.read()
fs.readlink(): read the value of a symbolic link
fs.realpath(): resolve relative file path pointers (., ..) to the full path
fs.rename(): rename a file or folder
fs.rmdir(): remove a folder
fs.stat(): returns the status of the file identified by the filename passed. Related: fs.fstat(), fs.lstat()
fs.symlink(): create a new symbolic link to a file
fs.truncate(): truncate to the specified length the file identified by the filename passed. Related: fs.ftruncate()
fs.unlink(): remove a file or a symbolic link
fs.unwatchFile(): stop watching for changes on a file
fs.utimes(): change the timestamp of the file identified by the filename passed. Related: fs.futimes()
fs.watchFile(): start watching for changes on a file. Related: fs.watch()
fs.writeFile(): write data to a file. Related: fs.write()

 all the methods are asynchronous by default, but they can also work synchronously by appending Sync.

for synchronous applications, the execution of the script will block the second operation until the first one is complete.
