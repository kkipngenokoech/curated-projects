# [CREATING A COMMENTS SECTION](https://dev.to/jamgar/how-to-create-a-comment-and-reply-system-in-ruby-on-rails-10ld)

to chain a comment to post or article or anything else:

1. make changes to your routes.rb and chain the resources
2. make changes to your models the comments and the main routes.
3. add a form to create comments in the view you want comments to appear
4. make changes to your controller in order to get the post id.
5. then render the comments

check out the [micro-reddit](../micro-reddit/), I made a comment for it.
