# CONTROLLERS

here we are going to  configure our controllers to show the right information on each route.

## [APPLICATION_CONTROLLER.RB](./app/controller/application_controller.rb)

here we are going to define /setup an authorization system to check whether or not the current user is authorized to access certain controller models and routes.
