# VIEWS

we have two controllers:

1. [USERS](app/controllers/users_controller.rb)
2. [SESSIONS](app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb)

for each of the controllers, we are going to create folders in our [views folder](./app/views/)

the naming convention of our views is `<action_name>.html.erb`.

rails will always automatically render the corresponding views to our controller actions.
