# ROUTES

## first route

I have set up a first route to test the routes:

so when you go to our [routes](config/routes.rb), I have set the root has (I will later comment out this part of our code) - `root "application#hello`.

then I will go to my controllers because that is the next part our users will be routed to when they try to access our site, they start from our [routes.rb](config/routes.rb) and then they are redirected to [controllers](app/controllers/)

## routing pages

here we are going to set our pages now.

we have the following pages:

1. signup
2. login
3. logout
4. me
